Math in html format.
====================

This is also a test of jqmath !
-------------------------------

These are famous theorems and identities written in HTML, JQuery, JQueryui and other libraries.

I intend to use this to test using *MathJax* instead of *JQmath*.

TODO
----
- Add relevant portraits of famous mathematicians in the background for each selection.
- Visualy animate content changes and coresponding portraits and decoration.
- Make selection of content other than by use of a <select> control.
