Math in html format.
====================

This is also a test of jqmath !
-------------------------------

These are famous theorems and identities written in HTML, JQuery, JQueryui and other libraries.

Styling guide : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Mathematics

I intend to use this to test using *MathJax* instead of *JQmath*.

TODO
----
- Fix sizes and crop the portraits of mathematicians in the background.
- Make selection of content other than by use of a <select> control.
